Followed a lot of [this tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) when building this app

Basic web app which allows users to post books and reviews thereof for a bookclub reference point. Mainly wrote it to familiarise myself with Python/flask and practise using tools such as git.

The code for the flask app is included but some pieces of code used to host my version of this app on heroku are not, such as the procfile.
